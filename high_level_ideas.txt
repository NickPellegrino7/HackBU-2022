SCENES
~~~~~~

(1) Hand State
- List of players, bots, and judge are listed on the left.
- Cards in your hand are visible before you.
- Tutorial on the top-right.
- Play a card, and it flies off the screen.
- "SABOTAGE" also happens on this screen. The host takes care of all the data.
- You play a card, and it flies off the screen.

(2) Judge State
- You see all the cards at once, and they have buttons under them iff you are the judge.
- Judge picks their favorite card combo.
- Rules explained at the top.
- Winner of the round (or the entire game) is shown. HOST must click "Next Round".

Maybe make it possible for players to join and spectate, and then they only get to play once someone disconnects or a bot is removed?

Or just automatically kill any bots that are in the way when a new player joins and wants the slot.
