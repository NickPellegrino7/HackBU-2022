You drink an entire bottle of hand sanitizer
You turn into a pancake
You get a flat tire
You total your car
You must brush your teeth after every bite of food
Someone keys your car
Every day you get a bloody nose for no reason
You must beat your heart manually at all times
You're struck by lightning
Everything smells like garbage to you now
Your phone breaks
You eat a rotten egg
You get a bad case of lice
You must agree to do anything anyone asks of you
You can’t use the internet for two days
A song you hate gets stuck in your head for a full week
You can’t fall asleep for a full week
You rub jalapeño juice in your eyes
You can no longer eat your favorite food
Someone spoils the ending of a movie you were excited to see
Every night you have at least one terrifying nightmare
You no longer know how to swim
You are always late for every meeting
Your farts will always sound loud and rude
There’s a 100% chance of bad weather tomorrow
Your fingernail breaks
You develop a permanent case of toenail fungus
You must always wear wet socks
You have no feet
You lose your ability to express emotion
You get a bad tattoo
You constantly have a stuffy nose
Your true love secretly hates you
One of your fingers gets chopped off
A random person slams a pie into your face
Over the period of one year you slowly turn into a potato
Another ear grows on the back of your neck
Every month at some random time you will go blind for one hour
You constantly feel constipated
You spill lemon juice in your open wound
You have a piece of dental floss caught in your teeth forever
All of your friends secretly hate you
Robots take over the world
You get a foot cramp
Your taxes are raised
You slam a door shut on your fingers
You give up on all of your hopes and dreams
You get a bad haircut
Your pet is feeling sick today
There’s an ant infestation in your bedroom
You require emergency surgery
You scrape your knee
You can no longer go outside
You will spend the final month of your life in prison
You don’t see your children for 20 years
You’re robbed
You have one month to live
The bank repossesses your house
You lose all of your hair
Every day a bug flies into your mouth
You can’t talk anymore
You have sore legs constantly for two years
You get a bad ear infection
You grow a tail
You always snore very loudly when you sleep
You break your nose
A movie you really wanted to see is cancelled
You’re fired from your job
You spill coffee on important documents at work
You develop an allergy to your favorite pet
You become allergic to butter and tomatoes
Your left shoe will always untie itself right after you tie it
You can no longer wear shoes
A dentist drills your teeth without using anesthesia
You chip a tooth and it cannot be fixed
As people get to know you, they’ll start to hate you
You no longer know how to read
You lose your sense of touch
Someone hacks into your computer
You must always buy everything you see advertised
The stock market crashes
Your hands are always sticky
You doubt every decision you make
Society shuns you as a liar and a fraud
Winter lasts for the entire year
Any amount of sunlight will burn your skin
You get hit by a meteor
You can’t think before you speak
All food tastes bad to you now
You fall ill during a vacation
Someone steals your work and claims it as their own
For the next week you can’t make any decisions
Your social interactions are crippled by your low self-esteem
Your GPS will always direct you to the wrong place
You forget everything you’ve done for the last four months
You outlive your friends and family and die sad and lonely
You are no longer able to keep track of time
You must join a new religion
Nobody takes you seriously
Your skin is completely removed
