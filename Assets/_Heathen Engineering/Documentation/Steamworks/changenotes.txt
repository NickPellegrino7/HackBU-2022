Breaking Changes:
- ClientApiSystem is now named SteamworksBehaviour
An obsolete ClientApiSystem class is included to help guid code conversion if required. It is recomended to use SteamSettings as opposed to SteamworksBhaviour or ClietnApiSystem as these mono behaviours are simply wrappers around the SteamSettings' funcitonality

Note:
This build uses a modified version of Steamworks.NET v15 based on Steamworks SDK v1.51
The modification corrects for a known issue involving the GameServer.Intit method and bindings on on the m_usSteam port change introduced in SDK v1.51

Patch Notes:
- Fixed a bug that would cause Unity Editor to not see the change of App ID in the Steam Settings object as a change and thus not save it to disk when edited
- Corrected event names in the Steam Settings and Steamworks Behaviour object for the Item Dropped event
- Updated the P2P demo scene to correct issues that caused the Set Game Server event to not be recieved by members of the lobby ... this is a WIP but should get users going while we build better demo scenes for networking.

====================
PLEASE NOTE
====================

Steamworks.NET comes preinstalled with this package in the folder ./_HeathenEngineering/Steamworks/Plugins/
If you already have Steamworks.NET installed you may need to resolve conflicts.
Of key importance is the assembly def "Setamworks.NET.asmdef" that we have added to ./_HeathenEngineering/Steamworks/Plugins/Steamworks.NET/
This assembly def is referneced by our own asembly defs located in each module of the Framework. If this is not present and does not include Steamworks.NET's objects you will have issues. 

To resolve the common issue of 
CSteamId is not found are you missing an assembly reference

Please locate the Steamworks.NET.asmdef that we have included  which should be located at ./_HeathenEngineering/Steamworks/Plugins/Steamworks.NET/Steamworks.NET.asmdef and move it to where ever you have Steamworks.NET plugin installed
such that it is housed within the Steamworks.NET folder that the plugin includes.

If you have issues where in Steam attempts to launch your game (or Spacewar) when you start simulating in Unity the most likely cause of this issue is that you do not have steam_appid.txt located in the root of your project.
steam_appid.txt is a simple text file that should be located in the root of your project (beside not in the Asset folder) it should contain only your app ID.

An example of a valid steam_appid.txt follows, only the content between the dashed lines should be used e.g. only the number 480 should be in the file.
               
               Start File
-----------------------------------------------
480
-----------------------------------------------
               End File
