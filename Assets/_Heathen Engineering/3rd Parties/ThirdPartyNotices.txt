====================
PLEASE NOTE
====================

Steamworks.NET comes preinstalled with this package in the folder ./_HeathenEngineering/Assets/Steamworks/Plugins/
If you already have Steamworks.NET installed you may need to resolve conflicts.
Of key importance is the assembly def "Setamworks.NET.asmdef" that we have added to ./_HeathenEngineering/Assets/Steamworks/Plugins/Steamworks.NET/
This assembly def is referneced by our own asembly defs located in each module of the Framework. If this is not present and does not include Steamworks.NET's objects you will have issues. 

To resolve the common issue of 
CSteamId is not found are you missing an assembly reference

Please locate the Steamworks.NET.asmdef that we have included  which should be located at ./_HeathenEngineering/Steamworks/Plugins/Steamworks.NET/Steamworks.NET.asmdef and move it to where ever you have Steamworks.NET plugin installed
such that it is housed within the Steamworks.NET folder that the plugin includes.
