FishNet tutorial:
- This is just FishNet in general; not SteamWorks specifically.
- However, you gotta understand FishNet first to then do FishNet with Steamworks.
- Video Tutorials to understand regular FishNet:
	- JUST WATCH the three videos I'm listing here. The rest are fluff that go into stuff more complicated than we really need.
	- Video I (44 seconds): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jICzEpcYt3A&list=PLkx8oFug638oaqxmw2Xm-VEq9CyYWyYzn
	- Video II (1 minute, 25 seconds): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1SsVgTmzyo&list=PLkx8oFug638pZWgTG7e4YeAzmBYF11QEJ
	- Video III (4 minutes, 28 seconds): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEzKJkPZvg0&list=PLkx8oFug638pZWgTG7e4YeAzmBYF11QEJ&index=2
- If you go to the "Multiplayer Work-In-Progress/test_executables" directory, you can find two executables that work for multiplayer on the same machine. Click "server" and "client" on one of them, and just "client" on the other, and players can see each other.
- I've included the Unity project named "AGAIG-Multiplayer" which contains the project that made test_executables. It basically just follows the 3 video tutorials I linked above.

FishySteamworks Tutorial:
- Okay, now that we understand FishNet, it's time to turn that NetworkManager into a Steamworks connection.
- This GitHub repo has a shitty 3-step tutorial (under "Setting Up" in the readme) that feels unfinished and is confusing: https://github.com/FirstGearGames/FishySteamworks
- Someone on discord turned it into a 6-step tutorial, which was also confusing / way over my head. But also I'm tired so idk what's even going on anymore. I've attached screenshots of that conversation in the "Multiplayer Work-In-Progress/Discord Screenshots" directory.
