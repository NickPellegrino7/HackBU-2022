Heathen has worked with the authors of Fizzy Steam Transport to make it compatable with Heathen's Steamworks.

As a result there is no longer any need for custom code or custom transports. You should install Mirror as normal, either from GitHub or from the Unity Package Manager.

And then install the latest version of Fizzy's Steam Transport.

**Note: we strongly recomend you do not install Fizzy Steam Transport from the Unity Package found in its GitHub releases rather you should download the code and drag it into your project.

The reason is the release package may include a copy of Steamworks.NET that has been modified and is likely to cause various issues.**
